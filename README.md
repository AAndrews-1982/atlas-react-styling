### Project Overview:
In this project you will implement the design for a music player using tailwind. This is the “Build a static version” of the Thinking in React Process.

- # Project Figma:

You do not need to worry about props, state or implementing the app functionality. That will be handled in a future project. For now focus on implementing the design to match the Figma.
